Data Cleaning Steps

1. Data types were adjusted for each column.
2. Cases were changed.
3. Extra blank spaces were trimmed.
4. Duplicates were removed.
5. Several unrelated data jobs were discarded by row filtering (invalid records).
6. Rows were ordered.
7. Location records were homogenized according to one criterion (full name of the Mexican State).
8. Job name records were homogenized according the previously data jobs categories: Business Analyst, Data Analyst, Data Architect, Data Engineer and Data Scientist
9. Not all the job positions had data about salaries, thus, the data set was duplicated in PowerQuery to analyze different portions of the data separately.
10. The first data was cleaned to only keep the job positions with data about salaries to analyze the data about salaries. 
11. The second data set was kept entirely to analize the total data jobs offer and the geographical distribution of the jobs.
12. The salary column in the first data set was split to separate the salary lower and upper limits into two different colums.
13. A new column with the average salary was created. When only one salary value was available, that value was retrieved without calculating an average.
14. Unnecessary columns were removed from both data sets.
15. Final cleaning steps were undertaken.
